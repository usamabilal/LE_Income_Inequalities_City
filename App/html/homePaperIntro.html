  <h3>Supplemental App</h3>
  <p>
    Our paper highlights key disparities in Life Expectancy in US MSAs with > 1
    million people. This app does two key things: 1) translate the figures in
    the paper into interactive visualizations which allow more granular
    exploration of the data presented 2) Delimits visualizations to all MSAs
    including those with population of less than 1 million residents.

  <h3>Abstract</h3>
  <p>
    Life expectancy in the US has declined since 2014, but we lack a
    characterization of disparities within and across metropolitan areas of the
    country. Using census tract-level life expectancy data from the 2010-2015 US
    Small-area Life Expectancy Estimates Project, we calculate nine measures of
    disparities in life expectancy within and across 359 Metropolitan
    Statistical Areas of the US. Cities in the South and Midwest had the widest
    life expectancy disparities, mostly driven by differences in life expectancy
    in areas of lower income. Cities in the West showed the narrowest
    disparities within MSAs, but also had the highest overall levels of life
    expectancy. We found that larger cities had significantly wider disparities.
    Compositional and contextual factors likely help explain variation in life
    expectancy disparities within and across cities. Further investment in
    local-level health-promoting social policies may reduce disparities in life
    expectancy.

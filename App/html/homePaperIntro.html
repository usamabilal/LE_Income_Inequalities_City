  <h3>Supplemental App</h3>

  <p>
    Our article highlights key disparities in life expectancy in US MSAs with >
    1 million people. This app does three key things: 1) translates the article
    figures into interactive visualizations, allowing more granular exploration
    of the article analysis 2) extends Table 1 to all US MSAs including those
    with populations of less than 1 million resident, and 3) allows exploration
    of figures using all 10 disparity measures. Please contact

  <h3>Abstract</h3>
  <p>
    Life expectancy in the US has declined since 2014, but we lack a
    characterization of disparities within and across metropolitan areas of the
    country. Using census tract-level life expectancy data from the 2010-2015 US
    Small-area Life Expectancy Estimates Project, we calculate nine measures of
    disparities in life expectancy within and across 359 Metropolitan
    Statistical Areas of the US. Cities in the South and Midwest had the widest
    life expectancy disparities, mostly driven by differences in life expectancy
    in areas of lower income. Cities in the West showed the narrowest
    disparities within MSAs, but also had the highest overall levels of life
    expectancy. We found that larger cities had significantly wider disparities.
    Compositional and contextual factors likely help explain variation in life
    expectancy disparities within and across cities. Further investment in
    local-level health-promoting social policies may reduce disparities in life
    expectancy.

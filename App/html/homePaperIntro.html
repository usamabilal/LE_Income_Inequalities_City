  <p>
    Our article highlights key disparities in life expectancy in US MSAs with >
    1 million people. This app does three key things: 1) translates the article
    figures into interactive visualizations, allowing more granular exploration
    of the article analysis 2) extends Table 1 to all US MSAs including those
    with populations of less than 1 million resident, and 3) allows exploration
    of figures using all 10 disparity measures. Please contact

  <h3>Abstract</h3>
  <p>
    Life expectancy in the US has declined since 2014, but we lack a
    characterization of disparities within and across metropolitan areas of the
    country. Using census tract-level life expectancy from the 2010-2015 US
    Small-area Life Expectancy Estimates Project, we calculate ten measures of
    total and income-based disparities in life expectancy at birth, age 25, and
    age 65 within and across 377 Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) of the
    US. We find wide heterogeneity in disparities in life expectancy at birth
    across MSAs and regions: MSAs in the West show the narrowest disparities
    (absolute disparity: 8.7 years, relative disparity: 1.12), while MSAs in the
    South (absolute disparity:9.13 years, relative disparity: 1.12) and Midwest
    (absolute disparity: 9.8 years, relative disparity: 1.13) have the widest
    life expectancy disparities. We also observe greater variability in life
    expectancy across MSAs for lower income census tracts than for higher income
    census tracts (Coefficient of Variation=3.7 and 2.3 for first vs tenth
    decile of income, respectively). Finally, we find that a series of MSA-level
    variables, including larger MSAs and greater proportion college graduates,
    predict wider life expectancy disparities for all age groups.
    Sociodemographic and policy factors likely help explain variation in life
    expectancy disparities within and across metro areas. Further investment in
    local-level health-promoting social policies may reduce disparities in life
    expectancy.

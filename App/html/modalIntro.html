    Heterogeneity in Disparities in Life Expectancy across US Metropolitan Areas
    (Supplemental App)
  </div>
  <div class="introModalText">
    Our article highlights key disparities in life expectancy in US MSAs with >
    1 million people. This app does three key things: 1) translates the article
    figures into interactive visualizations, allowing more granular exploration
    of the article analysis 2) extends Table 1 to all US MSAs including those
    with populations of less than 1 million resident, and 3) allows exploration
    of the Figure 1 using all 10 disparity measures.
